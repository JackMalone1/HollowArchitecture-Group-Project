A solitary Space Ranger drifted silently through the vast expanse of space in his pod, meticulously controlling a fleet of drones scattered throughout the area. His eyes, sharp and vigilant, scanned the screens before him for any signs of life. It had been over a week since his partner failed to return to base, with communication abruptly severed, leaving an unsettling void.

As he concentrated intently on the data streams, one of the drones began to exhibit erratic behavior, spinning wildly as it was inexorably drawn towards a black hole. The Space Ranger watched the chaotic footage, his heart racing, until the drone stabilized and transmitted an astonishing view.

Enlarging the screen, he was met with a sight that took his breath away: an entirely undiscovered galaxy, resplendent with seven planets, each ablaze with vibrant colors. Preliminary scans indicated the presence of life forces on all of them.

Could it be that his partner had unwittingly been pulled through this same portal? The possibility sparked a glimmer of hope. Perhaps his partner was already exploring these new worlds, encountering alien species and experiencing cultures beyond their wildest dreams. The Ranger’s mission had taken on a new dimension – not only to locate his lost comrade but also to chart and understand this magnificent, unknown galaxy.

- Contemplating his chances of survival, the Space Ranger quickly recorded a message for the base. He detailed his intentions and pinned the coordinates of the newfound galaxy, uncertain when or if the message would be received. Hesitant but determined, he steered his pod towards the portal.

Strapping himself in tightly, he reassured himself with thoughts of the adventures that lay ahead. Taking a deep breath, he allowed the black hole to seize the pod. As the vessel began to spin uncontrollably, he closed his eyes, chanting, "It'll be over soon, it'll be over soon!" His inner world roiled with nausea, his body fighting the urge to shut down.
 Time seemed to stretch into an eternity. Just as he was about to surrender to despair, the spinning gradually subsided. The pod regained control and drifted silently through space once more. Opening his eyes, the Ranger realized he had made it through. The black hole was behind him, and before him lay the uncharted galaxy, teeming with possibilities and the hope of reuniting with his partner.

 === Analysing ===
He analysed each one of the planets, the closest a rather small planet, dusty red of colour. The atmosphere looked to be extremely dry, with frequent sandstorms. The scans pick up heavy enough signs of life here, so it's worth landing upon and checking out. -> END
