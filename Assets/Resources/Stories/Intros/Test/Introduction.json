The Space Ranger watched the chaotic footage, his heart racing, until the drone stabilized and transmitted an astonishing view.","\n","^Enlarging the screen, he was met with a sight that took his breath away: an entirely undiscovered galaxy, resplendent with seven planets, each ablaze with vibrant colors.

The possibility sparked a glimmer of hope. Perhaps his partner was already exploring these new worlds, encountering alien species and experiencing cultures beyond their wildest dreams.
