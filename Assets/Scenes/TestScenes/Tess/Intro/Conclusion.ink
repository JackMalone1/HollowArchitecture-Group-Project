=== conclusion ===
You manage to rush over towards the man in the dark robes with the villager that guided you here. As you are rushing over, you see the elder start a chant to attempt at breaking the spell. The air crackled with magical energy as the elder begins her incantation, her voice raising in power. Lena drops the grimoire, frozen as she realises in horror where she is. She appears to finally be free from whatever spell that the mysterious man had put her under.

The Elder's chant reaches a crescendo and a brilliant light burst from her staff, enveloping the altar and the stranger. With a final, desperate cry, the dark-robed man was thrown back, the ritual shattered.
